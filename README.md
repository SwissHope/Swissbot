# Swissbot
This is the repository for the development and implementation of a Discord bot.

Details will follow soon about how the bot is to be installed. The code is provided as code and version management.

Likely this will have a server that it runs on, and a website to manage and maintain the details of the bot interactions. For most people, the installation and interaction with the bot will be provided automatically via a cloud hosted bot.

## Installation

To install, and manage, the bot, please go to [Swissbot](https://new.url.here/) to invite the bot to your server.

If you would like to self host, then you will need to be able to compile and run the code on a suitable device or cloud service.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major requests, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to to change.

Please update tests as appropriate.
